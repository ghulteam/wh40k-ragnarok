__What's this?__

Inspired by the the project of Fundamalleus [Fundapocalypse][] I wanted to provide an alternative Version for Apocalypse.
This extends the Original Repository [Apocalypse][] and will add new Datasheets in the style of the original Release and readjust some profiles and rules for gameplay.

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

The Files will be available through Github, when they are Ready.

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*
