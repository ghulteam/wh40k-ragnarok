__What's this?__

Inspired by the the project of Fundamalleus [Fundapocalypse][] I wanted to provide an alternative version for Apocalypse. <br />
This extends the original repository [Apocalypse][] and will add new Datasheets in the style of the original release and readjust some profiles and rules for gameplay. <br />
The catalogue ids were newly generated, so you should be able to have this set up in parallel to the Apocylpse repository.

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

You can add this repository to Battlescribe or New Recruit. <br />
Battlescribe URL: https://github.com/ghulteam/wh40k-ragnarok/releases/latest/download/wh40k-ragnarok.latest.bsi <br />
New Recruit: ghulteam/wh40k-ragnarok
