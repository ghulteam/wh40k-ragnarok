__What's this?__

Inspired by the the project of Fundamalleus [Fundapocalypse][] I wanted to provide an alternative Version for Apocalypse.
This extends the Original Repository [Apocalypse][] and will add new Datasheets in the style of the original Release and readjust some profiles and rules for gameplay.

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

You can add this repository to Battlescribe or New Recruit. 
Battlescribe URL: https://github.com/ghulteam/wh40k-ragnarok/releases/latest/download/wh40k-ragnarok.latest.bsi
New Recruit: ghulteam/wh40k-ragnarok
